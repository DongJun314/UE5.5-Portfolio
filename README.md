# DirectX 11–Based Map Tool–Focused Game Development Technical Demo (Team Project)

This project is a **team-based technical demo** conducted for learning purposes,  
focusing on the **design and implementation of a map editing tool**  
in a DirectX 11 environment.

Assuming a large-scale open-world environment,  
the project addresses tool-level challenges commonly encountered in real-world development,  
including pixel picking–based coordinate calculation,  
octree-based spatial partitioning,  
and efficient data saving and loading structures.

My primary contributions were related to  
the map tool system, pixel picking logic,  
and system-level data structure design.
